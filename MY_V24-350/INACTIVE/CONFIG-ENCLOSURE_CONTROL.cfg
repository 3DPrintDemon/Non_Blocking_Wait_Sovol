#target_temp: 40.0
#   A temperature (in Celsius) that will be the target temperature.
#   The default is 40 degrees.
#max_speed: 1.0
#   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
#   will be set to when the sensor temperature exceeds the set value.
#   The default is 1.0.
min_speed: 0
#   The minimum fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that
#   the fan will be set to for PID temperature fans.
#   The default is 0.3.
#gcode_id:
#   If set, the temperature will be reported in M105 queries using the
#   given id. The default is to not report the temperature via M105.
